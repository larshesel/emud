EMUD
===========

This is the Erlang Multi User Dungeon.

This project is used for learning Erlang - if you're looking for great
code, you're in the wrong place. I'm using this project as a testing
ground, trying out stuff, experimenting, testing...

If you do take a look at the code, then feel free to do anything with
it you like. Any contributions or criticisms of the code are also most
welcome :)

Have fun,

Trying it out
===========

1. Make sure you have a working installation of
[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/download.html) and Rebar
[Rebar](https://github.com/basho/rebar). 

2. Clone the project and do:

   * rebar clean compile
   * ./start_console.sh

And you should drop into a console as player1.
