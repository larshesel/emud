EMUD
===========

This is the Erlang Multi User Dungeon.

This project is used for learning Erlang - if you're looking for great code, you're in the wrong place. I'm using this project as a testing ground, trying out stuff, experimenting, testing...

If you do take a look at the code, then feel free to do anything with it you like. Any contributions or criticisms of the code are also most welcome :)

Have fun,
